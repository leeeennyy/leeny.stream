## leeny.stream
This is a personal website for my stream. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using Typescript, and is hosted on Firebase.

### Available scripts

#### `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode, with hot-reloading.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. 

#### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production and puts it in the `build` folder in the root directory.

#### `firebase serve`
This is to check that everything in the `build` folder is as expected, as this is what Firebase will receive
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

#### `firebase deploy`
Deploys the app to Firebase.
